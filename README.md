# My Journey into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Welcome to my personal learning repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my progress as I dive into the world of web development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What You'll Find Here

- <a href="https://github.com/dedekharisma/html-basic">**HTML Basic**</a>: The foundation of any web page. I'm exploring how to structure content, use semantic elements, and build the skeleton of a web page.
- <a href=https://github.com/dedekharisma/html-form>**HTML form**</a>: One of the most essential parts of any interactive website.
- <a href=https://github.com/dedekharisma/css-basic>**CSS**</a>: Styling is where the magic happens! I'm learning how to bring life to my web pages with colors, layouts, responsiveness, and some basic animations.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity to my projects. This includes understanding the DOM, handling events, and making web pages dynamic and engaging.

## Why I'm Doing This

I've always been fascinated by the web and how it works. This repository is my way of taking the first steps towards becoming a proficient web developer. By documenting my journey here, I hope to track my progress and maybe even help others who are on a similar path.

Thanks for checking out my work, and happy coding!
